\title{Extract Gene Names from Protein Descriptions}
\usage{
extractGeneNames(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Dataframe containing at least a "Description" column with protein descriptions.
The description is expected to contain gene name information and organism data (OS=).}
}
\value{
A dataframe with an added "Gene" column, cleaned "Description" column, and reordered
  columns with Gene, Description, and Accession first.
}
\description{
Extracts gene names from the Description column of a dataframe (typically from proteomics data)
and cleans up the description by removing organism information (OS=). Reorders columns to place
Gene, Description, and Accession at the beginning.
}
\examples{
# Extract gene names from proteomics data
cleaned_data <- extractGeneNames(protein_df)
}
