\title{Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA)}
\usage{
performPCA(df, sample, scale = TRUE, center = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Dataframe containing numeric values. Rows are features (e.g., genes, proteins)
and columns are samples.}

\item{sample}{A character vector containing the sample names/labels for each column in df.
Must have the same length as the number of columns in df.}

\item{scale}{Logical, whether to scale the data to unit variance (default: TRUE).}

\item{center}{Logical, whether to center the data to zero mean (default: TRUE).}
}
\value{
A list containing three elements:
  - [[1]]: dataframe with PCA coordinates (PC1, PC2, ...) and Sample column
  - [[2]]: character string for x-axis label (PC1 with variance explained)
  - [[3]]: character string for y-axis label (PC2 with variance explained)
}
\description{
Given a numeric dataframe, performs PCA by transposing the dataframe (so that samples
become rows and features become columns). Automatically filters out rows with zero
variance and handles missing values by replacing them with zeros. Returns PCA results
including transformed coordinates, variance explained, and axis labels.
}
\examples{
# Perform PCA on proteomics data
sample_names <- c("Control_1", "Control_2", "Treatment_1", "Treatment_2")
pca_results <- performPCA(protein_data, sample = sample_names)

# PCA without scaling
pca_results <- performPCA(protein_data, sample = sample_names, scale = FALSE)
}
