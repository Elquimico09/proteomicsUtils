\title{Perform ANOVA on Multiple Cohorts}
\usage{
performANOVA(..., comparisons = "all", log_scale = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Data frames, each containing data for one cohort.
All data frames must have the same number of rows.}

\item{comparisons}{Which pairwise comparisons to include in output. Options:
- "all" (default): include all pairwise comparisons
- A list of character vectors specifying pairs, e.g.,
  list(c("control", "treated"), c("control", "placebo")).
  Group names must match the variable names passed in.}

\item{log_scale}{Logical; whether input data are already on a log scale.
- TRUE (default): fold change is computed as mean(group2) - mean(group1)
- FALSE: fold change is computed as mean(group2) / mean(group1), and log2fc
  is computed as log2(fold change)}
}
\value{
A named list with:
  - data: A data frame with the combined original data plus computed columns:
    anova_pvalue, tukey_pvalue_X_Y, foldchange_X_Y, and log2fc_X_Y.
  - cohort_columns: A named list where each element corresponds to a cohort
    and contains the original column names for that cohort.
}
\description{
Takes data frames as arguments, each belonging to a cohort, and performs an ANOVA on each row.
Works dynamically with 3 or more groups. The function returns a data frame with the p-value
from the ANOVA, Tukey's HSD p-values for pairwise comparisons, and fold changes for each
pairwise comparison. Column names are automatically derived from the variable names passed in.

\examples{
# For 3 groups (all pairwise comparisons)
result <- performANOVA(control, treated, placebo)
result$data
result$cohort_columns

# Only specific comparisons
result <- performANOVA(control, treated, placebo,
                       comparisons = list(c("control", "treated"),
                                          c("control", "placebo")))
