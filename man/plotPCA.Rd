\title{Plot Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Results}
\usage{
plotPCA(pca_list, title = "Principal Component Analysis")
}
\arguments{
\item{pca_list}{A list containing PCA results from performPCA(). Expected structure:
- [[1]]: dataframe with PC1, PC2, and Sample columns
- [[2]]: x-axis label (PC1 with variance explained)
- [[3]]: y-axis label (PC2 with variance explained)}

\item{title}{Character, the title of the plot (default: "Principal Component Analysis").}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object containing the PCA scatter plot.
}
\description{
Creates a 2D scatter plot of PCA results showing PC1 vs PC2. Takes the output from
performPCA() and generates a publication-ready plot with variance explained in axis labels.
Points are colored by sample groups and styled with the ggprism theme.
}
\examples{
# Perform PCA and plot
sample_names <- c("Control_1", "Control_2", "Treatment_1", "Treatment_2")
pca_results <- performPCA(protein_data, sample = sample_names)
plotPCA(pca_results)

# Plot with custom title
plotPCA(pca_results, title = "PCA of Protein Expression")
}
