\title{Perform 2-Way ANOVA with Automatic Grouping}
\usage{
perform2WayANOVA(df, factor1, factor2, comparisons = "all")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe where each row is a variable and columns represent different samples.}

\item{factor1}{A character vector of levels for the first factor (e.g., c("Male", "Female")).}

\item{factor2}{A character vector of levels for the second factor (e.g., c("control", "disease")).}

\item{comparisons}{Either "all" for all pairwise comparisons, or a list of specific comparisons
for Tukey's post-hoc test. Each comparison should be a vector of 2 group names formed by
combining factor levels with a space (e.g., "Male control").
Example: list(c("Male control", "Male disease"), c("Female control", "Female disease"))}
}
\value{
A dataframe with ANOVA results, including main effects, interaction, and Tukey post-hoc tests:
  - anova2way_pvalue_overall: minimum p-value across all effects
  - anova2way_pvalue_factor1: main effect p-value for first factor
  - anova2way_pvalue_factor2: main effect p-value for second factor
  - anova2way_pvalue_interaction: interaction effect p-value
  - tukey_pvalue_X_Y: Tukey's HSD p-values for specified comparisons
  - foldchange_X_Y: fold changes (mean differences) for specified comparisons
}
\description{
Performs 2-way ANOVA on each row of a dataframe with automatic grouping based on two factors.
Takes a single dataframe where columns represent different combinations of two factors.
For example, if you have male control, female control, male disease, and female disease samples,
you can specify factor1 = c("Male", "Female") and factor2 = c("control", "disease"), and the
function will automatically group the columns accordingly.

# Example with male/female and control/disease
result <- perform2WayANOVA(data,
                           factor1 = c("Male", "Female"),
                           factor2 = c("control", "disease"),
                           comparisons = list(c("Male control", "Male disease"),
                                            c("Female control", "Female disease")))
